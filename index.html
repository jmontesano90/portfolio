            <p>I am currently a Biologist working to restore marsh ecosystems while simultaneously reduce mosquito populations.
I am a graduate of Thinkful's Web Developer bootcamp program.  I love building things from the ground up, and the absolute freedom that coding allows.
Being able to show what work you have tangibly accomplished during the day is something I greatly enjoy about coding and something I like bringing to the workforce.

When I'm not working or learning more about code I'll be either at the gym, enjoying a video game or hanging out with my bearded dragon.</p>
